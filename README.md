# Smart Home
Using an Arduino set, C and a Python script to send reports to ThingSpeak, I aimed to replicate, monitor and report the idea of a Smart Home system.

I included both a screen snippet from the ThingSpeak dahsboard for this project, as well as the very unique setup of my Arduino itself.

(*I am in no way a professional electritian, as you will likely see with the system itself. This was really fun to do, but not my brightest moment I'll be honest hahaha*)
